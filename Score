Forbidden Tablet

Setup:

6-8 performers, all with iPads, with amplified sound, preferably powered speakers. Sounds should originate as close to the performer as possible.

Tables that have been balanced with a level will be useful for setting down the devices.

Each player should be able to make eye contact with one another.

The player closest to stage left is the lead player.

Score:

I pads should be held flat. Tilting in any direction causes the sound to be actuated.

Each player may choose their own spectrum with the multi-slider, they may change their multi-slider at any time they are not making sound.

After each player has selected their spectrum they wait.

Lead player tilts slowly in any direction until the loudest sound is reached, then tilts back to a flat position.

At the tail end of the Leader’s note, the player to the Leader’s Left begins to tilt their device to start their own note

The note should never appear to end, but rather travels around the ensemble. Once it reaches the last player on stage right it should then be handed back to the player on stage right.

In between notes, players may change their spectrum, but they should never change spectrum during their note.

The work shall be over when 12 cycles left to right have been completed returning to the Lead player 12 times.
